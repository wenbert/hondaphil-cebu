#Summary

On May 2, 2018 my family from Cebu Philippines bought a new Honda Brio from Honda Cars Cebu, Inc. https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Honda+Cars+Cebu,+Inc./@10.3102662,123.9142775,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x6fc165968d4a65bc?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt472Z28jbAhULa7wKHbmOC8MQ_BIItgMwPw

We paid for the full amount but the car we got had so many problems that even until now, June 10, 2018 the problem is still exists. In the first email I’ve sent to customer_relations@hondaphil.com I’ve document how often we've been going back to Honda Cars Cebu, Inc. for checking / "fixes".

The purpose of this is to publicly monitor the process of this ordeal. I hope it gets much needed media attention so that at least we get the car that we paid for.

On June 3, 2018, I went to Twitter to contact @hondaphil - I got a reply and was asked to email customer_relations@hondaphil.com

This is my first email sent on: Jun 6, 2018, 7:44 PM

**Subject: Problem with Honda Brio (DT18__)**

This email is regarding the Honda Brio (DT18__) that my brother -bought-. (I have removed my brother's name for the meantime)

I initially reported this issue on Twitter:

I will update my status in Twitter for movement until a satisfactory resolution is met. 

My brother paid for the Honda Brio on May 3 with cash. I can attach necessary documents if you need further proof.

After purchasing, he noticed a knocking sound of the left side. He got concerned as it seem to come from the chassis. It was not negligible and he had safety concerns. Being a brand new purchase he did not expect to have too many problems - that is one of the main reasons he went for a brand new car.

He notified the agent on May 6, 2018 through text message and finally they got the queue slip on May 11, 2018.

Aside from the very concerning knocking sound, my brother also noticed these problems:

1. Rough paint finish from the middle going to the left most of the front bumper
1. Melting glue on the front grill and melted glue marks on the front bumper
1. loose headlight assembly (left side)
1. mis-alignment of front left side of the bumper
1. nick marks on the left bumper that touches the left headlight
1. misaligned aligned horn button
1. misaligned aligned hood latch, doesn't close properly (in order to close it you have to bang it harder than we usually do. "compared it to the display unit and the unit of my in-law , we bought it together")
1. small rust formation (on some parts) 
1. crack on the hood stopper left side

**Here are some more details:**

**May 15 2018, (Tuesday)**

* Retightening was done on under-chassis but it wasn’t reflected on the job order or remarks
* Honda removed the left front headlight and we test drived the unit - the knocking sound did NOT go away. Honda thought that the problem was with the headlights, but it wasn’t. This also was not reflected on the job order or remarks
* The melted glue on the grill was also not reflected on the job order remarks. (Refer to item #2 above)
* Slight rust formation was not reflected on the job order or remarks
* Nick marks on front left bumper was not  reflected on the job order or remarks
* Rough paint finish from the middle going to the left most of the front bumper was not reflected on the job order or remarks
* Misalignment of left front bumper  was not reflected on the job order or remarks
* misaligned aligned hood latch, doesnt close properly (in order to close it you have to bang it harder than we usually do. "compared it to the display unit and the unit of my in-law , we bought it together") not on remarks


See attached document for the job order on this date.


**May 23 2018 (Wednesday)**

Honda replaced the  whole left front shock absorber assembly. This DID NOT solve the issue. The knocking sound is still there. See pictures to attached


**May 24 , 2018 (Thursday)**

Honda requested the unit to be left with them and gave us a service vehicle which is a Honda HRV (service vehicle - test drive unit)

Note: receipt image attached


We returned the Honda HRV the following day May 25, 2018  

(NOTE: Our Brio was still with Honda Cebu Service Center)


**May 26 2018 (Saturday)**

* Honda released the unit with full confidence that they have fixed the issue,  after they replaced the following:
* Front whole bumper including the grille  ( which they swapped from the display unit Conduction Sticker DS 9762 according to the Service Manager)
* Left side headlight assembly ( which they swapped from the display unit Conduction Sticker DS 9762 according to the Service Manager)
* Stabilizer Link Left Part
* They aligned the hood latch


**May 27-30 2018**

The knocking sound persisted and we informed the service manager. Who told us to bring back the unit to their Service Center.

**May 31 2018 (Thursday)**

We brought the unit back to Honda but we were not given any Job Order because the service manager said it was a Continuing Repair.

In the course of our conversation, in his office, the service manager said he cannot release the unit upon orders, because of a safety issue. In addition he said that he had already contacted Honda Philippines that they will send their staff to check our Unit. He mentioned the date Monday or Tuesday which is June 4 2018  (Monday) or  June 5 2018 (Tuesday), and so we agreed to leave our unit.

** June 1 2018 (Friday) **

We went back to Honda Cars Cebu Inc. NRA Branch and wanted to talk to the service manager since he wasn't around, we went to the General Manager.

We asked the General Manager if we could pull out our unit since the HCPI Staff will be in Cebu on the said dates June 4 2018 or June 5 2018 yet, so we could use it instead of it being idle in the service center. 

The GM readily agreed and even instructed his staff to have it full tank of gas.

We asked for a receipt of the repair order from our service adviser with the following remarks

1. Replace Bumper Spacer front LH (06-01-2018)
1. Replace Shock Absorber assy front LH (05-15-2018) <<< wrong date was encoded, this was actually replaced on 5-23-2018
1. Replace stabilizer link LH (05-24-2018)
1. Replace headlight LH and Front Bumper (5-24-2018)
1. Parallel Lower Arm and Retightening front LH Fender
1. Insulate fender LH using Aerotape (06-01-2018)


**June 2 2018 (Saturday)**

We brought back our unit because of the same complaint which was not really resolved at all.

Nick marks on the left side of the front bumper have re-occured.

Left headlight assembly now has the same hollow sound.

Left front fender has the same hollow sound even with the aerotape being placed behind.


**June 4 2018 (Monday)**

We brought back our unit for our 1st Periodic Maintenance Service.


As you can see, we’ve had a LOT of issues and have been dealing with Honda to resolve the issue. My brother bought a brand new car expecting no problems.


Do you really think this is the quality that Honda should be proud of? Is this how you deal with customers?


Honda has replaced so many parts on a brand new car. In which they could have replaced the whole unit and saved my brother a lot of time, stress, and headaches. 

If you need a video with sound of it, I can also send it to you.

In this email/letter, we are formally requesting a unit replacement. We are no longer confident with the job and quality of the existing unit. We are concerned for our safety and the over-all resale of the unit.

If a replacement is not available, then we would like to request a full refund of the amount paid.

We will wait for your email reply. Please treat this urgently - we have already been very patient with the whole process and it has caused us a lot of stress.

Best regards,

Wenbert

This is still on-going. I will update this file for progress. We've had back-and-forth emails from Honda but no real progress yet.
